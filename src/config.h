/** @brief Enumerates all possible system modes
 * 
 * Example projects. These are all fully-functional and located in example.h/.c
 * Refer to them as needed for examples of how to use the system.
 * 
 * SYSMODE_TEST1; will compile the project to apply one of several simple audio
 * DSP effects to either the internal waveform or the microphone input,
 * switching between effects depending on keys pressed on the keyboard and
 * between audio sources when pressing the user button.
 * SYSMODE_TEST2; will compile the project in a basic loop-back mode.
 * Will output the waveform to the left channel and output the microphone input
 * to the right channel. Can be used to verify the functionality of the entire
 * board and build environment and as a minimalist example of how to access the
 * microphone input and speaker outputs.
 * SYSMODE_TEST3; will compile the project to apply a frequency shift to the
 * microphone input and play back the result on both output channels. The
 * frequency shift is implemented using the FFT, where the size of the FFT is
 * set to AUDIO_BLOCKSIZE.
 * SYSMODE_TEST4; will compile the project to output a QPSK-modulated ASCII
 * bitstream on the left channel when the button is pressed and implement a ML
 * receiver on the microphone input, displaying received characters on the
 * terminal.
 * SYSMODE_RADAR; will compile the project for a pulse radar (i.e.
 * time-of-flight) distance-measurement example.
 * (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar#Transit_time)
 * SYSMODE_FFT; will compile the project for a simple filtering example, where
 * filtering is performed in the frequency domain rather than the naive
 * time-domain approach. For long enough block-sizes this is computationally
 * faster as a FIR filter of length N scales in computational complexity on the
 * order of N^2, while the FFT requires N*log(N). I.E. for large N eventually
 * the FFT approach is numerically faster.
 * 
 * 
 * Course projects. These are missing some lines of code (which you need to add).
 * 
 * SYSMODE_OFDM; will compile the project for the OFDM project.
 * Will call the lab_ofdm() function when AUDIO_BLOCKSIZE samples are
 * available from the microphone.
 * 
 * SYSMODE_LMS; will compile the project for the LMS adaptive filter project.
 * Will call the lab_dsp_lms() function when AUDIO_BLOCKSIZE samples are
 * available from the microphone.
 * 
 * Note; only one system mode may be defined at a time!
