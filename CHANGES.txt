Backend;
	1.3.1 - Added ASCII-plot function for visualizing data directly on the device
	1.3.0 - Added multiple waveforms to select from
		  - Unified source code style in sources.c
		  - Altered system mode selection style, reduced risk for inadvertently selecting an invalid operation mode
	1.2.0 - Updated block subsystem to write to a target buffer instead of maintaining local copies.
		  - Various changes to reduce memory usage applied.
		  - Added envelope detector and queued buffer blocks in the misc.h/.c files, primarily intended to be used in the OFDM lab. 
	1.1.0 Added support for bi-directional USART communication. Incoming characters are now added to a FIFO buffer and can be handled on an application basis. This can be as simple as reading the incoming characters and using a large switch statment to handle the various effects that each character should have.
	1.0.0 Initial release
	
Examples;
	1.1.3 Radar example rewritten for clarity

	1.1.1 Updated examples to use backend version 1.2.0
	1.1.0 Updated example 2 to use the new bi-directional USART communications link to select between the different effects.
	1.0.0 Initial release
	
Lab;
